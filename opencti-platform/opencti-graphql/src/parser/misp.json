Embassies in Belgium, Ukraine, China, Jordan, Greece, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Poland, and Germany were all attacked, though researchers from Kaspersky Lab and Symantec could not confirm which countries were the true targets. In one case from May 2012, the office of the prime minister of a former Soviet Union member country was infected, leading to 60 further computers being affected, Symantec researchers said. There were some other victims, including the ministry for health of a Western European country, the ministry for education of a Central American country, a state electricity provider in the Middle East and a medical organisation in the US, according to Symantec. It is believed the group was also responsible for a much - documented 2008 attack on the US Central Command. The attackers - who continue to operate - have ostensibly sought to carry out surveillance on targets and pilfer data, though their use of encryption across their networks has made it difficult to ascertain exactly what the hackers took.Kaspersky Lab, however, picked up a number of the attackers searches through their victims emails, which included terms such as Nato and EU energy dialogue Though attribution is difficult to substantiate, Russia has previously been suspected of carrying out the attacks and Symantecs Gavin O’ Gorman told the Guardian a number of the hackers appeared to be using Russian names and language in their notes for their malicious code. Cyrillic was also seen in use.'",

        "content": "Based on both Microsoft Threat Intelligence’s findings and those reported by governments and other security vendors, we assess that the Russian nation-state actor tracked as Secret Blizzard has used the tools and infrastructure of at least six other threat actors during the past seven years. They also have actively targeted infrastructure where other threat actors have staged exfiltrated data from victims with the intention of collecting this data for their own espionage program. We assess that Secret Blizzard’s use of other actors’ infrastructure and tools, both state-sponsored and cybercriminal, is exclusively for facilitating espionage operations.\r\n\r\nIn this first of a two-part blog series, we discuss how Secret Blizzard has used the infrastructure of the Pakistan-based threat activity cluster we call Storm-0156 — which overlaps with the threat actor known as [SideCopy](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1008/), [Transparent Tribe](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0134/), and APT36 — to install backdoors and collect intelligence on targets of interest in South Asia. Microsoft Threat Intelligence partnered with [Black Lotus Labs](https://blog.lumen.com/snowblind-the-invisible-hand-of-secret-blizzard/), the threat intelligence arm of Lumen Technologies, to confirm that Secret Blizzard command-and-control (C2) traffic emanated from Storm-0156 infrastructure, including infrastructure used by Storm-0156 to collate exfiltrated data from campaigns in Afghanistan and India. We thank the Black Lotus Team for recognizing the impact of this threat and collaborating on investigative efforts. In the second blog, Microsoft Threat Intelligence will be detailing how Secret Blizzard has used Amadey bots and the PowerShell backdoor of two other threat actors to deploy the [Tavdig](https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/) backdoor and then use that foothold to install their [KazuarV2](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/upgraded-kazuar-backdoor-offers-stealthy-power) backdoor on target devices in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence tracks Secret Blizzard campaigns and, when we are able, directly notifies customers who have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to help secure their environments. As part of our continuous monitoring, analysis, and reporting on the threat landscape, we are sharing our research on Secret Blizzard’s activity to raise awareness of this threat actor’s tradecraft and to educate organizations on how to harden their attack surfaces against this and similar activity. In addition, we highlight that, while Secret Blizzard’s use of infrastructure and access by other threat actors is unusual, it is not unique. Therefore, organizations compromised by one threat actor may also find themselves compromised by another through the initial intrusion.\r\n\r\nWho is Secret Blizzard?\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has [attributed](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-129a) Secret Blizzard to Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which is [one of Russia’s Signals Intelligence and Computer Network Operations (CNO) services](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russias-fsb-malign-cyber-activity-factsheet/russias-fsb-malign-activity-factsheet) responsible for intercepting and decrypting electronic data as well as the technical penetration of foreign intelligence targets. Secret Blizzard overlaps with the threat actor tracked by other security vendors as [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/), Waterbug, Venomous Bear, Snake, Turla Team, and Turla APT Group.\r\n\r\nSecret Blizzard is known for targeting a wide array of verticals, but most prominently ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, government offices, defense departments, and defense-related companies worldwide. Secret Blizzard focuses on gaining long-term access to systems for intelligence collection using extensive resources such as multiple backdoors, including some with peer-to-peer functionality and C2 communication channels. During intrusions, the threat actor collects and exfiltrates documents, PDFs, and email content. In general, Secret Blizzard seeks out information of political importance with a particular interest in advanced research that might impact international political issues. Campaigns where Secret Blizzard has used the tools or compromised infrastructure of other threat adversaries that have been publicly reported by other security vendors include:\r\n\r\n*   Accessing tools and infrastructure of Iranian state-sponsored threat actor Hazel Sandstorm (also called OilRig, APT-34 and Crambus) in 2017, as reported by [Symantec](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments) and [the US and UK intelligence services](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/18/2002197242/-1/-1/0/NSA_CSA_Turla_20191021%20ver%204%20-%20nsa.gov.pdf)\r\n*   Reusing [Andromeda malware](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1074/) to deploy the [KopiLuwak](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1075/) and [QuietCanary](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1076/) backdoors in 2022, as reported by [Mandiant](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/turla-galaxy-opportunity/).\r\n*   Using the backdoor of the Kazakhstan-based threat actor tracked by Microsoft Threat Intelligence as Storm-0473, also called Tomiris, in an attempt to deploy QuietCanary in 2022, as reported by [Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/tomiris-called-they-want-their-turla-malware-back/109552/).\r\n\r\nWhile not unique, leveraging the access of other adversaries is a somewhat unusual attack vector for threat actors in general. Secret Blizzard’s use of this technique highlights their approach to diversifying attack vectors, including using strategic web compromises ([watering holes](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/03/12/tracking-turla-new-backdoor-armenian-watering-holes/)) and [adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) campaigns](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/) likely facilitated via legally mandated intercept systems in Russia [such as the “System for Operative Investigative Activities” (SORM](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/01/09/turlas-backdoor-laced-flash-player-installer/)). More commonly, Secret Blizzard uses server-side and edge device compromises as initial attack-vectors to facilitate further lateral movement within a network of interest.\r\n\r\nCompromise and post-compromise activities\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSince November 2022, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed Secret Blizzard compromising the C2 infrastructure of a Pakistan-based espionage cluster that we track as Storm-0156. Secret Blizzard has used Storm-0156’s backdoors to deploy their own backdoors to compromised devices. In addition, Secret Blizzard tools have been deployed to virtual private servers (VPS) staging Storm-0156’s exfiltrated data.\r\n\r\nThe initial access mechanism used by Secret Blizzard to compromise Storm-0156 infrastructure is currently not known. In some instances, observed by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-0156 appeared to have used the C2 server for a considerable amount of time, while in other observed incidents Storm-0156 began accessing the VPS when Secret Blizzard deployed tools.\r\n\r\nOn the VPS used for C2, Storm-0156 operators consistently deploy a tool with the filename _ArsenalV2%.exe_. This is a server-side C2 tool that Microsoft Threat Intelligence refers to as Arsenal. Arsenal is an executable built on top of the cross-platform application development framework QtFramework, indicating it may also be deployed on operating systems other than Windows. Upon execution, Arsenal listens over a hardcoded port for incoming requests from controlled devices. Once connected, the tool enables threat actors to upload or download files to or from the device on which it is deployed.\r\n\r\nWhen Arsenal is deployed, at least two SQLite3 databases, named _ConnectionInfo.db_ and _DownloadPriority.db_, are set up. Arsenal uses these databases to store and look up information in different tables, such as:\r\n\r\n*   Uploaded files and a distinct username of the uploader\r\n*   Affected device information, including IP address, location, operating system version, and installed antivirus software\r\n*   Network connection events, duration of the session, and timestamps like the disconnect and connect time\r\n\r\nInitially, Secret Blizzard deployed a fork of the [TinyTurla backdoor](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/tinyturla/) to Storm-0156 C2 servers. However, since October 2023, Secret Blizzard predominantly has been using a .NET backdoor that Microsoft Threat Intelligence refers to as TwoDash alongside a clipboard monitoring tool referred to as Statuezy. Shortly after we observed the deployment of these capabilities, our partner Black Lotus Labs observed C2 communication from the Storm-0156 C2 infrastructure to dedicated Secret Blizzard C2s. This privileged position on Storm-0156 C2s has allowed Secret Blizzard to commandeer Storm-0156 backdoors such as CrimsonRAT, which was previously observed in Storm-0156 campaigns in [2023](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector/) and [earlier](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_dk/research/22/a/investigating-apt36-or-earth-karkaddans-attack-chain-and-malware.html), and a Storm-0156 Golang backdoor we refer to as Wainscot.\r\n\r\nStorm-0156 extensively uses a renamed version (_cridviz.exe, crezly.exe_) of the Credential Backup and Restore Wizard, _credwiz.exe_ which is vulnerable to DLL-sideloading, to load malicious payloads using a file name _DUser.dll_. Secret Blizzard often drops their own malicious payloads into a directory separate from that used by Storm-0156, but also uses _credwiz.exe_ to load their malicious payload in a file called _duser.dll_. This DLL may contain a simple Meterpreter-like backdoor referred to as MiniPocket or the previously referenced TwoDash .NET backdoor. Secret Blizzard’s use of DLL-sideloading using the same legitimate executable and malicious payloads having similar names to those used by Storm-0156 may indicate Secret Blizzard attempts to masquerade as Storm-0156. Another Search-Order-Hijack used by Secret Blizzard is the deployment of TwoDash into the directory _c:\\\\windows\\\\system32_ with the filename _oci.dll_ and then using the default Windows installation Distributed Transaction Coordinator, _msdtc.exe_, to DLL-sideload the malicious payload in _oci.dll_ as described by a [Penetration Testing Lab blog published in 2020](https://pentestlab.blog/2020/03/04/persistence-dll-hijacking/).\r\n\r\n![Diagram depicting Secret Blizzard first compromising Storm-0156 C2 infrastructure to deploy either TinyTurla or TwoDash, alongside Statuezy to the server. Second, Secret Blizzard implants are deployed to Storm-0156 C2 servers, and beacon to known Secret Blizzard C2 servers. Secret Blizzard then commandeers Storm-0156 backdoors to deploy TwoDash or Minipocket into existing victim networks, which have been observed within the Afghanistan government and other victim networks. Finally, Secret Blizzard implants and establishes a C2 channel with Secret Blizzard infrastructure, completing deployment.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Figure-1.-Secret-Blizzard-and-Storm-0156-chain-of-compromise-1-1024x361.webp)\r\n\r\n_Figure 1. Secret Blizzard and Storm-0156 chain of compromise_\r\n\r\nIn August 2024, Microsoft observed Secret Blizzard using a CrimsonRAT compromise that Storm-0156 had established in March 2024. Secret Blizzard is assessed to have commandeered the CrimsonRAT backdoor to download and execute Secret Blizzard’s TwoDash backdoor. Additionally, Microsoft observed instances of Secret Blizzard accessing Storm-0156’s CrimsonRAT on target devices in India. One of these CrimsonRAT deployments was configured with a C2 server at Contabo (_ur253.duckdns\\[.\\]org_: 45.14.194\\[.\\]253), where Secret Blizzard had deployed the clipboard monitor tool in January, February, and September 2024. Between May and August 2024, [Black Lotus Labs](https://blog.lumen.com/snowblind-the-invisible-hand-of-secret-blizzard/) confirmed network activity indicating backdoor communication from this same CrimsonRAT C2 to known Secret Blizzard infrastructure.\r\n\r\nSecret Blizzard backdoors deployed on Storm-0156 infrastructure\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### TinyTurla variant\r\n\r\nSimilar to the [TinyTurla](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0668/) backdoor reported by [Cisco Talos in 2021](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/tinyturla/#:~:text=Cisco%20Secure%20Malware%20Analytics%20(Threat%20Grid)), the TinyTurla variant is installed using a batch file and disguises itself as a Windows-based service. The batch file also configures a variety of registry keys used by the malware including _Delay_ (sleep time), _Key_ (public key), and _Hosts_ (C2 addresses).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of code depicting the mp.bat file containing configuring parameters for the TinyTurla variant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Figure-2.-mp.bat-file-containing-configuring-parameters-for-the-TinyTurla-variant-1024x198.webp)\r\n\r\n_Figure 2. mp.bat file containing configuring parameters for the TinyTurla variant_\r\n\r\nWhile there is not complete feature parity between the TinyTurla variant sample and the sample analyzed by Cisco Talos, there are significant functional and code overlaps.\r\n\r\n### TwoDash\r\n\r\nTwoDash is a custom downloader comprised of two main components: a native Win32/64 PE file and a .NET application. The native binary acts as a loader for the .NET application which it decrypts and executes. The .NET application conducts a basic device survey and sends this information to the configured C2 servers. Finally, it waits for follow-on tasks, which are compiled as additional .NET assemblies/modules.\r\n\r\n### Statuezy\r\n\r\nStatuezy is a custom trojan that monitors and logs data saved to the Windows clipboard. Each time the clipboard is updated with new data, the trojan saves the current timestamp, associated clipboard format (such as CF\\_TEXT), and the clipboard data itself to a temporary file which we assess is exfiltrated by a separate malware family.\r\n\r\n### MiniPocket\r\n\r\nMiniPocket is a small custom downloader that connects to a hardcoded IP address/port using TCP to retrieve and execute a second-stage binary.\r\n\r\nStorm-0156 backdoors used in this campaign\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Wainscot\r\n\r\nWainscot is a Golang-based backdoor seen in the wild since at least October 2023. This backdoor can handle various commands from C2, including launching arbitrary commands, uploading and downloading files, and taking screenshots on the target host. Though Microsoft Threat Intelligence has primarily observed this backdoor targeting Windows users, we also have identified public reports of a possible Wainscot variant targeting Linux-based platforms. Interestingly, this Linux variant has far more features than the Windows variant.\r\n\r\n### CrimsonRAT\r\n\r\nCrimsonRAT is a .NET-based backdoor with varied capabilities that has gone through multiple iterations over the years. The most recent variant of CrimsonRAT analyzed by Microsoft Threat Intelligence can gather system information, list running processes, file information, download or upload files, and execute arbitrary commands on target. We also have observed CrimsonRAT dropping additional modules to act as a keylogger on the target host.\r\n\r\nWho has been affected by Secret Blizzard’s compromises using Storm-0156 infrastructure?\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan, Secret Blizzard generally has used their positions on Storm-0156 C2 servers to deploy backdoors to devices within the extended Afghan government—including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), and foreign consulates of the government of Afghanistan. In each of these cases, we observed the deployment of Storm-0156 backdoors which were subsequently used to download the Secret Blizzard tools to target devices in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nIn India, Secret Blizzard generally appears to have avoided direct deployment via Storm-0156 backdoors, instead deploying Secret Blizzard backdoors to C2 servers or Storm-0156 servers hosting data exfiltrated from Indian military and defense-related institutions. We observed only one instance of Secret Blizzard using a Storm-0156 backdoor to deploy the TwoDash backdoor to a target desktop in India. The difference in Secret Blizzard’s approach in Afghanistan and India could reflect political considerations within the Russian leadership, differing geographical areas of responsibility within the FSB, or a collection gap on Microsoft Threat Intelligence’s part.    \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe frequency of Secret Blizzard’s operations to co-opt or commandeer the infrastructure or tools of other threat actors suggests that this is an intentional component of Secret Blizzard’s tactics and techniques. Leveraging this type of resource has both advantages and drawbacks. Taking advantage of the campaigns of others allows Secret Blizzard to establish footholds on networks of interest with relatively minimal effort. However, because these initial footholds are established on another threat actor’s targets of interest, the information obtained through this technique may not align entirely with Secret Blizzard’s collection priorities. In addition, if the threat actor that established the initial foothold has poor operational security, this technique might trigger endpoint or network security alerts on the tools deployed by the actor conducting the initial compromise, resulting in unintended exposure of Secret Blizzard activity.\r\n\r\nMitigation and protection guidance\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo harden networks against the Secret Blizzard activity listed above, defenders can implement the following:\r\n\r\n### Strengthen Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configuration\r\n\r\n*   Microsoft Defender XDR customers can implement [attack surface reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-implement) to harden an environment against techniques used by threat actors\r\n    \r\n    *   [Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-execution-of-potentially-obfuscated-scripts)\r\n    \r\n    *   [Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands)\r\n    \r\n    *   [Block executable files from running](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#block-executable-files-from-running-unless-they-meet-a-prevalence-age-or-trusted-list-criterion) unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion\r\n    \r\n    *   [Block abuse of exploited vulnerable signed drivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-abuse-of-exploited-vulnerable-signed-drivers)\r\n    \r\n    *   [Block Webshell creation for Servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-webshell-creation-for-servers)\r\n*   [Enable network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection) in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\r\n*   Ensure [tamper protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection#how-do-i-configure-or-manage-tamper-protection) is enabled in Microsoft Dender for Endpoint\r\n*   Run endpoint detection and response in [block mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode) so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode\r\n*   Configure [investigation and remediation](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations) in full automated mode to let Microsoft Defender for Endpoint take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume\r\n\r\n### Strengthen Microsoft Defender Antivirus configuration\r\n\r\n*   [Turn on PUA protection in block mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-microsoft-defender-antivirus) in Microsoft Defender Antivirus\r\n*   Turn on [cloud-delivered protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus) in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving threat actor tools and techniques\r\n*   Turn on Microsoft Defender Antivirus [real-time protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus)\r\n\r\n### Strengthen operating environment configuration\r\n\r\n*   Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support [SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/web-protection-overview) which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.

        "content": "## Executive Summary\r\n\r\n Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs has uncovered a longstanding campaign orchestrated by the Russian-based threat actor known as “Secret Blizzard” (also referred to as Turla). This group has successfully infiltrated 33 separate command-and-control (C2) nodes used by Pakistani-based actor, “Storm-0156.” Known for their focus on espionage, Storm-0156 is associated in public reporting with two activity clusters, “SideCopy” and “Transparent Tribe.” This latest campaign, spanning the last two years, is the fourth recorded case of Secret Blizzard embedding themselves in another group’s operations since 2019 when they were first seen repurposing the C2s of an Iranian threat group.\r\n\r\n In December 2022, Secret Blizzard initially gained access to a Storm-0156 C2 server and by mid-2023 had expanded their control to a number of C2s associated with the Storm-0156 actor. From their vantage point within these servers, Secret Blizzard leveraged the pre-existing access obtained by Storm-0156 to deploy their own malware, “TwoDash” and “Statuezy,” into a handful of networks linked to various entities within the Afghan government. Notably, in April 2023, Secret Blizzard advanced their operations by moving into the workstations of Pakistani-based operators. Through this channel, they potentially acquired a wealth of data. This bounty included insights into Storm-0156’s tooling, credentials for both C2s and targeted networks, as well as exfiltrated data collected from prior operations.\r\n\r\n By mid-2024, Secret Blizzard had expanded their focus to include the use of two other malware families, Waiscot and CrimsonRAT, which they appropriated from the Pakistani workstations. CrimsonRAT was previously found in use against government and military targets in India. Secret Blizzard later took advantage of their access to gather data from prior deployments of the malware.\r\n\r\n Lumen Technologies extends its gratitude to our partners at the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Team (MSTIC) for their invaluable contributions in tracking and mitigating this threat. This report is released in conjunction with MSTIC’s blog, which provides further insight into these events. The Microsoft blog can be found here.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n ## Introduction\r\n\r\n Black Lotus Labs has monitored a diverse array of nation-state actors, including a previous report on a Secret Blizzard campaign that utilized strategic compromises against Ukrainian websites, which is one characteristic that distinguishes this group more than any other: their audacity in exploiting other threat actors’ C2 servers for their own purposes. This strategy allows Secret Blizzard to remotely acquire sensitive files that were previously exfiltrated from compromised networks, without employing (and possibly exposing) their own tools; crucially, operations such as these avoid or delay attribution. In scenarios where the other threat actors have not acquired all the data of interest on their targets, they can search the data collected on C2 nodes for stolen authentication materials to gain access or use existing access to expand collection and deploy their agents into a network. By doing so, Secret Blizzard essentially takes advantage of the foothold created by the original threat actor.\r\n\r\n While this method of data collection offers unique benefits, a malicious actor who stops there would be limited to gathering data or gaining access only within networks controlled by a single C2 node. Secret Blizzard continued to exploit trust relations by moving from an actor’s C2 nodes into the operator’s workstations. We believe that nation-state and cybercriminal endpoints and malware are especially vulnerable to exploitation since they are unable to use modern security stacks for monitoring access and protecting against exploitation. When threat actors have installed security products, it has resulted in the disclosure of their previously unknown exploits and tools. We suspect that the routine deletion of log data, a standard best practice for threat actors, compounds the exposure.\r\n\r\n This report illustrates the meticulous and systematic approach Secret Blizzard took to expand their operations in the middle east over the past two years. We will start by briefly describing the Storm-0156 (SideCopy/Transparent Tribe) modus operandi, then show how Storm-0156’s access was leveraged, allowing Secret Blizzard to target Afghanistan government networks beginning in 2022. We suspect they manipulated the trust relationship from those Storm-0156 C2s to move into the Pakistani computer network operators’ workstations, pilfering data from those nodes along the way, to include the Waiscot and CrimsonRAT malware used to interact with Indian-based networks.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n ## Technical Details\r\n\r\n ### **Overview of Storm-0156 Modus Operandi and Previously Undocumented Tradecraft**\r\n\r\n Black Lotus Labs had previously tracked an activity cluster associated with Storm-0156, a nation-state actor operating out of Pakistan. This threat actor uses a diverse array of both open-source tools such as AllaKore, and custom remote access trojans over the past several years. While Storm-0156 has demonstrated proficiency in adapting their tools to different operating systems, including the recent integration of python-based tools for Linux systems, their fundamental tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have remained relatively unchanged. Broadly speaking, Storm-0156’s engagements primarily target regional governmental organizations, with a persistent focus on Afghanistan and India, including entities in government, technology, and industrial control systems such as power generation and distribution.\r\n\r\n In January 2023, Lumen observed a Storm-0156 campaign, using a single VPS,185.217.125[.]195 that had a “hak5 Cloud C2” banner and was administered from known Storm-0156 C2s. This banner indicated that the server was acting as a cloud-based C2 configured to control a suite of Hak5 tools. Hak5 equipment is unique as it offers hardware-based solutions for “red teams, pentesters, cyber security students and IT professionals.” Unlike the commodity RATs previously used by Storm-0156, Hak5 equipment requires having physical access to a workstation, a network cable, or proximity to a WiFi Pineapple. While the use of close access equipment has been observed before, it is seldom reported upon. Once installed, these devices can either surreptitiously retrieve data or run predefined scripts. The advantage of hardware-based attacks lies in their design, which allows users to effectively bypass standard EDR/XDR protections.\r\n\r\n This campaign came to light after the new server was administered from two known Storm-0156 operational nodes; the first node, 209.126.6[.]227, connected from January through February 2023. The second node, 209.126.81[.]42 reported by Qi’anxin, connected to this new server from February through July 2023. Analysis of the telemetry associated with this Hak5 Cloud C2 revealed a significant volume of data flow associated with a limited number of entities. These were an Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Europe, an Indian national defense organization and several other government bodies, all taking place from December 2022 through March 2023.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  *Figure 1: Logical Connections between Storm-0156’s Hak5 Cloud C2 and known C2s.*\r\n\r\n  ### Secret Blizzard Gains Access to Storm-0156 C2s\r\n\r\n While monitoring the Storm-0156 campaigns, we uncovered 11 C2 nodes that were active from December 2022 through mid-2023. Black Lotus Labs observed malware samples or public reporting corresponding for 8 of the 11 nodes. Closer analysis revealed that these 11 all communicated with three newly identified VPS IP addresses. The VPSs caught our eye, as they were leased through a provider that we had not seen used in previous Storm-0156 campaigns. Our counterparts at MSTIC were able to confirm that the three nodes were associated with Secret Blizzard, who used the following three IP addresses from at least December 2022 through August 2023: 146.70.158[.]90, 162.213.195[.]129, 146.70.81[.]81.\r\n\r\n Although we cannot be certain how Secret Blizzard identified the remaining three nodes that did not correspond to public malware samples or reporting, we suspect they could have used a method of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) pivoting outlined here by Team Cymru. The full list of Storm-0156 IP addresses and the timeframe of interaction with the 2023 Secret Blizzard C2s are as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n * 154.53.42[.]194; Dec 11, 2022 – Oct 7, 2024\r\n * 66.219.22[.]252; Dec 12, 2022 – July 9, 2023\r\n * 66.219.22[.]102; Dec 27, 2022 – Aug 9, 2023\r\n * 144.126.152[.]205; Dec 28, 2022 – Mar 2, 2023\r\n * 185.229.119[.]60; Jan 31 – Mar 14, 2023\r\n * 164.68.108[.]153; Feb 22 – Aug 21, 2023\r\n * 209.126.6[.]227; Feb 27 – Mar 22, 2023\r\n * 209.126.81[.]42; April 30 – July 4, 2023\r\n * 209.126.7[.]8; May 5 – Aug 22, 2023\r\n * 154.38.160[.]218; April 12 – Aug 23, 2023\r\n * 144.126.154[.]84; June 23 – Aug 21, 2023\r\n \r\n We observed a continuation of this same behavior in 2024; however, Secret Blizzard rotated their C2 nodes in 2024 to the following IP addresses; 146.70.158[.]90, 162.213.195[.]192. The list of nine Storm-0156 IP addresses and the timeframe of interaction with the 2024 Secret Blizzard C2s are shown below:\r\n\r\n \r\n * 173.212.252[.]2; May 29 – Oct 10, 2024\r\n * 185.213.27[.]94; May 26 – Aug 24, 2024\r\n * 167.86.113[.]241; May 28 – Aug 9, 2024\r\n * 109.123.244[.]46; May 28 – Oct 18, 2024\r\n * 23.88.26[.]187; May 29 – Oct 20, 2024\r\n * 173.249.7[.]111; Aug 28 – Oct 24, 2024\r\n * 62.171.153[.]221; May 27 – Oct 21, 2024\r\n * 173.212.252[.]2; May 29 – Nov 20, 2024\r\n * 149.102.140[.]36; May 28 – Sept 2, 2024\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n ### Secret Blizzard Drops their own Tooling into Afghan Government Networks\r\n\r\n During our monitoring of Secret Blizzard’s interactions with the Storm-0156 C2 nodes, we identified beaconing activity from various Afghan government networks that Storm-0156 threat actors had previously compromised. This leads us to believe, with high confidence, that Secret Blizzard used their access to the Storm-0156 C2s to gather essential network information and deploy their own malware, “Two-Dash,” into the Afghan government networks.\r\n\r\n We observed communications from several IP addresses based in Afghanistan. The duration and volume of data transferred indicated that three of these IP addresses showed beaconing activity for just a week, suggesting that Secret Blizzard chose not to maintain long-term access. However, three other networks appeared to be of greater interest, as they showed beaconing activity over months with significant data transfers:\r\n\r\n \r\n * Secret Blizzard C2 node, 146.70.158[.]90, found interacting with six IP addresses and was active from at least January 23, 2023, through September 4, 2023.\r\n * Secret Blizzard C2 node, 162.213.195[.]129, communicated with five IP addresses and was active from December 29, 2022, through September 4, 2023.\r\n * Secret Blizzard C2 node, 167.88.183[.]238, transmitted to only one IP address on April 17, 2023.\r\n \r\n From at least May through October 2024, we observed persistent connections from the same handful of Afghan government networks, the only notable difference is that the C2 rotated aligning with the prior Storm-0156 infections to 143.198.73[.]108.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n ### Into the Void: Surreptitious Entry to The Pakistani Operator Network\r\n\r\n The most critical observation of this campaign was the detection of Two-Dash beaconing activity, not only from Storm-0156 C2 nodes in Afghanistan, but also from a dynamic IP address originating in Pakistan.\r\n\r\n On May 4th, 2023, the Pakistani IP address 182.188.171[.]52 connected to a known AllaKore C2 node via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from 6:19:00 through 10:48:00 UTC. During this time window, the same Pakistani IP address 182.188.171[.]52 established a connection to the known Secret Blizzard IP address 146.70.158[.]90, from 05:57:00 through 08:13:00. Given the connection duration of almost two hours, and the fact that the Secret Blizzard IP address 146.70.158[.]90 was used as a C2 server to both Storm-0156 C2 nodes and Afghan government victims, it is highly indicative that they compromised Storm-0156 operators themselves. We then observed intermittent connections from various dynamic IP addresses that geolocate to Pakistan connecting to known Secret Blizzard C2s.\r\n\r\n We suspect they leveraged access to the Storm-0156 C2 panel, then abused a trust relationship to move laterally into the Storm-0156 operator’s workstation. This achievement could have enabled them to access additional networks previously compromised by Storm-0156, which includes other middle eastern governmental entities.\r\n\r\n  *Figure 2: Secret Blizzard infiltrating both Storm-0156 and Afghan government networks*\r\n\r\n ### Double Secret Probation: Secret Blizzard Targets C2s Associated with Indian Network\r\n\r\n Starting in 2024, Lumen’s continuous monitoring of the Secret Blizzard infrastructure revealed interactions with a subset of CrimsonRAT C2 nodes, which had previously been used to target the Indian government and military. Notably, Secret Blizzard only engaged with seven CrimsonRAT C2s, though our data indicated that several more were available. This selective engagement implies that, while they had the capability to access all nodes, their tool deployment was strategically limited to those associated with the highest priority targets in India. The seven that were most attractive were:\r\n\r\n \r\n * 38.242.219[.]13; May 29 – Oct 20, 2024\r\n * 5.189.183[.]63; June 2 – Aug 11, 2024\r\n * 62.171.153[.]221; May 27 – Oct 13, 2024\r\n * 38.242.211[.]87; May 29 – Oct 5, 2024\r\n * 45.14.194[.]253; May 26 – Sept 18, 2024\r\n * 173.212.206[.]227; May 29 – Aug 2, 2024\r\n * 209.145.52[.]172; May 27 – Nov 21, 2024\r\n \r\n Lumen also observed Storm-0156’s Indian-based targeting with a previously undocumented malware family dubbed Waiscot, which was a Go-compiled remote access trojan. The Waiscot malware along with other Storm-0156 malware families were used to interact with the following Indian-based IP addresses:\r\n\r\n \r\n * 130.185.119[.]198; Dec 9, 2022 – Aug 14, 2024\r\n * 173.249.18[.]251; Feb 15 – Aug 24, 2023\r\n * 176.57.184[.]97; May 31 – Oct 20, 2024\r\n * 209.126.11[.]251; May 25 – June 13, 2024\r\n \r\n We also observed other malware families used to target Indian-based organizations such as ActionRat, those IP addresses and timeframes were as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n * 144.91.72[.]17; Dec 16, 2022 – April 26, 2023\r\n * 84.247.181[.]64; May 27 – Nov 17, 2024\r\n \r\n An interesting observation was that although Lumen detected Secret Blizzard interacting with various C2s, we did not see Secret Blizzard deploying their own agents, like Two-Dash or Statuezy, into Indian networks. It remains unclear whether they moved downstream into those victims, as they might have either taken relevant data from the C2s or were using the existing agents that Storm-0156 had already established to submit their data requests.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n ## Conclusion\r\n\r\n The Secret Blizzard activity cluster, along with its parent organization, the Russian FSB, has consistently employed sophisticated tradecraft to achieve their goals while maintaining the secrecy of their operations. Unlike other Russian groups, which often use a variety of techniques to create plausible deniability— such as operating through residential proxy networks managed by cybercriminals or using commercially available frameworks like Cobalt Strike—Turla has opted for a unique strategy. Compromising the command-and-control servers of other threat actors not only helps them gather the information they seek but also shifts the blame to other groups if incident response efforts reveal exploitation on these networks. We have documented this case study because we believe this approach will likely persist, especially as Western nations, including the United States and European allies, continue to uncover and condemn Russian activities in cyberspace.\r\n\r\n Black Lotus Labs continues to monitor and track nation-state Russian activity clusters to help protect and better secure the internet. To that end, we have blocked traffic across the Lumen global backbone to all the architecture related to both Secret Blizzard and the various sub-clusters of Storm-0156. We have added the indicators of compromise (IoCs) from this campaign into the threat intelligence feed that fuels the Lumen Connected Security portfolio. We will continue to monitor new infrastructure, targeting activity, and expanding TTPs, and we will continue to collaborate with the security research community to share findings related to this activity.\r\n\r\n We strongly recommend treating all compromises as equally concerning, regardless of whether the activity flags for a nation-state malware family or appears related to cybercrime, as both have been co-opted by Secret Blizzard in the past. We encourage the community to monitor for and alert on these and any similar IoCs. We also advise the following:\r\n\r\n \r\n * A well-tuned EDR solution that routinely receives signature updates for all network assets, as well as centralized monitoring looking for signs of lateral movement within a network.\r\n * Look for large data transfers out of the network, even if the destination IP address is physically located in the same geographical area.\r\n * All organizations: Consider comprehensive secure access service edge (SASE) or similar solutions to bolster their security posture and enable robust detection on network-based communications.\r\n \r\n Analysis of Secret Blizzard’s activity was performed by Danny Adamitis. Technical editing by Ryan English.\r\n\r\n For additional IoCs associated with this campaign, please visit our GitHub page.\r\n\r\n If you would like to collaborate on similar research, please contact us on social media @BlackLotusLabs.\r\n\r\n *This information is provided “as is” without any warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied.
