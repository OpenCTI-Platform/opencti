Continue working on a change by creating the next artifact.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Every unscoped example of those commands below is shorthand: before running it, append the flag. For example, run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json --store "<id>"`, not the unscoped form shown below. Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes sorted by most recently modified, and ask the user to select one

   When prompting, present the top 3-4 most recently modified changes as options, showing:
   - Change name
   - Schema (from `schema` field if present, otherwise "spec-driven")
   - Status (e.g., "0/5 tasks", "complete", "no tasks")
   - How recently it was modified (from `lastModified` field)

   Mark the most recently modified change as "(Recommended)" since it's likely what the user wants to continue.

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/opsx-continue <other>`).

2. **Check current status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand current state. The response includes:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow schema being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - `artifacts`: Array of artifacts with their status ("done", "skipped", "ready", "blocked")
   - `isPlanningComplete`: Boolean indicating if all planning artifacts are complete. Older CLI versions expose the same value as `isComplete`.
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context. Use these instead of assuming repo-local paths.

3. **Act based on status**:

   ---

   **If all planning artifacts are complete (`isPlanningComplete: true`, or legacy `isComplete: true`)**:
   - Congratulate the user
   - Show final status including the schema used
   - Suggest: "Planning is complete! You can now implement this change. Once implementation and any tracked work are complete, archive it."
   - STOP

   ---

   **If artifacts are ready to create** (status shows artifacts with `status: "ready"`):
   - Pick the FIRST artifact with `status: "ready"` from the status output
   - Get its instructions:
     ```bash
     openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     ```
   - Parse the JSON. The key fields are:
     - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
     - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance
     - `resolvedOutputPath`: Resolved path or pattern to write the artifact
     - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context (entries with `skipped: true` have no files - do not look for them)
     - `skipped`/`warning`: present when the change declares skip_specs and this artifact must NOT be created - pick another artifact
   - **Create the artifact file**:
     - Read any completed dependency files for context - always re-read them from disk, even if you saw them earlier in the conversation (the user may have edited them)
     - If the `instruction` field delegates creation to a specific skill or command, invoke it to produce the artifact instead of writing the file yourself, then verify the artifact file exists at `resolvedOutputPath`
     - Otherwise use `template` as the structure - fill in its sections
     - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints when writing - but do NOT copy them into the file
     - Write to the `resolvedOutputPath` specified in instructions. If it is a glob pattern, choose the concrete file path using the schema instruction and the change's context
   - Show what was created and what's now unlocked
   - STOP after creating ONE artifact

   ---

   **If no artifacts are ready (all blocked)**:
   - This shouldn't happen with a valid schema
   - Show status and suggest checking for issues

4. **After creating an artifact, show progress**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After each invocation, show:
- Which artifact was created
- Schema workflow being used
- Current progress (N/M complete)
- What artifacts are now unlocked
- Prompt: "Want to continue? Just ask me to continue or tell me what to do next."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

The artifact types and their purpose depend on the schema. The `instruction` field from the instructions output is the authoritative guidance for each artifact - follow it even when the artifact has a familiar name (proposal.md, tasks.md, etc.), since custom schemas may define different content or a different process for the same file names.

If the `instruction` field directs you to use a specific skill or command to create the artifact, invoke it instead of writing the artifact directly.

**Guardrails**
- Create ONE artifact per invocation
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one - re-read from disk, not from conversation memory (files may have changed since you last saw them)
- Never skip artifacts or create out of order
- If context is unclear, ask the user before creating
- Verify the artifact file exists after writing before marking progress
- Use the schema's artifact sequence, don't assume specific artifact names
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output
